      <h2 style="color:red">Mechanical Engineering</h2>
      <p>Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that involves the design, construction, and use of
        mechanical systems. Mechanical engineers apply mathematics and engineering principles to design and build
        machines, including vehicles, tools, and structures. Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of
        physics,chemistry, biology, and materials science to solve problems and develop new technologies.</p>

    <div id="civil">
      <h2 style="color:red">Civil Engineering</h2>
      <p>Civil engineers design, build, and maintain the foundation for our modern society – our buildings, roads and
        bridges, drinking water and energy systems, sea ports and airports, and the infrastructure for a cleaner
        environment, to name just a few.</p>

    <div id="electrical">
      <h2 style="color:red">Electrical and Electronics Engineering</h2>
      <p>Focuses on the large-scale production and distribution of electrical power. Electrical engineers design,
        develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar, and
        navigation systems. They also design electrical systems for automobiles and aircraft.</p>

    <div id="computer">
      <h2 style="color:red">Computer Engineering</h2>
      <p>Computer engineering is a field that combines electrical engineering and computer science to design and develop
        hardware and software systems. Computer engineers work on all aspects of computer operating systems, including
        robotics and software. They typically work in research labs, private sectors, and government agencies.</p>

    <div id="electronics">
      <h2 style="color:red">Electronics and Communication Engineering</h2>
      <p>Electronics & Communication Engineering deals with the electronic devices, circuits, communication equipments
        like transmitter, receiver, integrated circuits (IC). It also deals with basic electronics, analog and digital
        transmission & reception of data, voice and video (Example AM, FM, DTH), microprocessors, satellite
        communication, microwave engineering, antennae and wave progression. It aims to deepen the knowledge and skills
        of the students on the basic concepts and theories that will equip them in their professional work involving
        analysis, systems implementation, operation, production, and maintenance of the various applications in the
        field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.</p>

    <div id="chemical">
      <h2 style="color:red">Chemical Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Chemical engineering is a discipline influencing numerous areas of technology. In broad terms, chemical
        engineers conceive and design processes to produce, transform, and transport materials — beginning with
        experimentation in the laboratory followed by the implementation of the technology in full-scale production.

    <div id="aerospace">
      <h2 style="color:red">Aerospace Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the design, development, testing, and
        production of aircraft, spacecraft, and related systems and equipment.

    <div id="petroleum">
      <h2 style="color:red">Petroleum Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on the production of hydrocarbons, such as crude
        oil and natural gas. Petroleum engineers work with geoscientists and other specialists to explore for oil and
        gas deposits, and then determine how to extract them.
